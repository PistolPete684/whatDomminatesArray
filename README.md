# whatDomminatesArray
A zero-indexed array arr consisting of n integers is given. The dominator of array arr is the value that occurs in more than half of the elements of arr. For example, consider array arr such that arr = [3,4,3,2,3,1,3,3] . The function should return âˆ’1 if array does not have a dominator. All values in arr will be >=0.
